InProgress:

Thea is a monk without a monastery.

Her earliest memories are of growing up amongst the other students at the Monastery of Flowing Water.  The monastery was an immense, extremely old complex, the most preeminent location of the Kaoist order.  Located in the empire of [some empire] which has spread through the the kingdoms, focused primarily in the empire of [some other empire].

She was a prodigy like the monks had never seen.  By age 7 she had mastered the first form.  By age 12 she had won the imperial hand fighting tournament.  Ki flowed through her, but so too did the Kaoist philosophy.  The world was an illusion, patience and humbleness were virtues.  It was all about karma.

At the age of 18 she was sent to be the stanard bearer and spiritual advisor of [some powerful family with an army / emperor / the army].  She guided and advised powerful people, attempting to always remind herself spiritual and maintain compassion.

Over the next few years she grew close to generals, advisors, soldiers and their familes.  

At this point the emperor grew fearful of the power and influence of the monks.  The war began, and three years later, at the battle of Fanisan bridge, the war ended.  Thea never discusses this time, and believes strongly

- battle with mistake
- during campaign monastery attacked because too political, too powerful.  Felt torn between assigned duty and rushing home, but discipline never lack.
- because of mistake and monastery destruction, (maybe political implications or favored generals / family members dying) spiritual crisis, lost connection with ki
- traveling around looking for direction, looking to reconnect to what she knew and the spiritual attunement she once had
